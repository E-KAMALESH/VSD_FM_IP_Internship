1.​ Where is the RISC-V program located in the vsd-riscv2 repository?
The RISC-V example programs are stored in the samples directory of the repository.

2.​ How is the program compiled and loaded into memory?
First, the C source code is compiled into machine code.
During compilation, it is converted into assembly, then into binary, and finally linked.
After that, the resulting binary is written into memory (or flashed into ROM/flash), so the processor can execute it.

3.​ How does the RISC-V core access memory and memory-mapped IO?
The RISC-V core reads and writes data using memory addresses.
Normal memory stores instructions and data.
For memory-mapped I/O, specific address ranges are reserved for hardware peripherals, allowing the CPU to communicate with devices by reading/writing those addresses.

4.​ Where would a new FPGA IP block logically integrate in this system?
A new FPGA IP block would function like a peripheral device.
It would be connected to the system bus and assigned a specific memory address range.
The CPU can then control or read from it using memory-mapped I/O operations.
